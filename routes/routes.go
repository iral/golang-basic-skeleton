package routes

func Routes() {
	// Code for route should be placed here
	// also controller name can be passed here

	// So exact way of how its working is that
	// 1. Routes called -> Controllersconst
	// 2. Controllers called -> Servicesconst
	// 3. Service does the required things and also calls -> DB operations like fetch/update/insert/delete and gives the result
}
